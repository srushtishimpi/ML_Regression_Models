# SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION - FUEL CONSUMPTION DATA
In this project, I am using dataset of fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. To proceed further, this data split into training and test sets. Then created a model using training set and evaluate it using test set. Finally use model to predict unknown value and compared predicted accuracy of all the factors to find which factor is affecting this fuel consumption the most.

## ```FuelConsumption.csv```:
We have downloaded a fuel consumption dataset, ```FuelConsumption.csv```, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
