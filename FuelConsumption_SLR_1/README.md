# SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION - FUEL CONSUMPTION DATA
In this project, I am using dataset of fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. To proceed further, this data split into training and test sets. Then created a model using training set and evaluate it using test set. Finally use model to predict unknown value and compared predicted accuracy of all the factors to find which factor is affecting this fuel consumption the most.

## Dataset: ```FuelConsumption.csv```
We have downloaded a fuel consumption dataset, ```FuelConsumption.csv```, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

## About Linear Regression
Linear Regression fits a linear model with coefficients B = (B1, ..., Bn) to minimize the 'residual sum of squares' between the independed x in the dataset, and the depended y by the linear approximation.

## Applying Simple Linear Regression on following factors:
1. Engine Size
2. Cylinder
3. Fuel Consumption in City
4. Fuel Consumption on Highway
5. Fuel Consumption Combined

## Environment Setting

1. Imported needed packages
2. Understanding the data
3. Data Exploration

## Following task performed on each regression model

1. Visualizing the data
2. Splitting the data into train and test data
3. Training the data distribution
4. Creating a data model
5. Plotting the data for visualization
6. Testing the data
7. Predicting the accuracy of the regression model
8. Comparing and evaluating best regression model
